# aurora-dmhuisma

My own Universal Blue image, based on aurora-dx. For now this just brings back vfio support that was removed in [this commit](https://github.com/ublue-os/aurora/commit/30ebaa574056d4caf9c04589feaacbc2243544c8).

This does not bring back the setup scripts than were removed, it just configures the image.
