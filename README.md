# aurora-dmhuisma

NOTICE: This image will no longer be updated in favor of using Bluebuild instead.
https://github.com/dmhuisma/aurora-dx-dmhuisma

My own Universal Blue image, based on aurora-dx. For now this just brings back vfio support and the kvmfr kernel module that was removed.

This does not bring back the setup scripts than were removed, it just configures the image.
